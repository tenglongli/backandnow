# backandnow: 
Bayesian back-calculation and nowcasting based on line-list data (under development)
## Retrospective Simulation
- `cluster.R`: Parallel processing for the simulation. 
- `report.rds`: First reported curve input.
- `report1.rds`: Second reported curve input.
- `sce1.rds`: Simulation output under the first scenario.
- `sce2.rds`: Simulation output under the second scenario.
- `sce3.rds`: Simulation output under the third scenario.
- `sce4.rds`: Simulation output under the fourth scenario. 
- `simulation_back.R`: Detail simulation design and postprocessing. 
## Source code
- `backnow1.cpp`: Bayesian back-calculation and nowcasting. 
## Document
- `Back_calculation_and_nowcasting.pdf`: Draft manuscript. 
## Future work
- Prospective simulation.
- Better Bayesian processing code.
- Empirical example using Covid data from the CDC.
